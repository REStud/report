                This report covers the period between September 1, 2022 and August 31, 2023. In this period, 91 replication packages have been submitted and 89 packages have been accepted. 

                We now have three complete years of data under the new Data Availability Policy. This makes it possible to make comparisons and identify changes.
                             
                ## Turnaround times

                The vast majority of packages are accepted only after revisions; only seven packages were accepted as submitted. Most packages are accepted on first revision. The Figure plots the number of packages by revisions at the time acceptance. Around 78 percent of packages are accepted after at most one revision (up from 55 percent last year).

                The average package accepted this year received their first response from the Data Editor in 27 days (up from 15 days last year). There were some notable outliers, as discussed below.
                This statistic excludes papers where the Data Availability Policy does not apply. For revisions, the mean response time is 14 days, with the majority of packages decided in much shorter time (see Figure).

                ## Reasons for revision

                The Figure shows the main reasons for sending back the first version of the package for revision. More than half of the packages miss or have incomplete data citations, a Data Availability Statement, or both. About a third of the packages do not save or include the reproducible exhibits to be verified. (We stopped requiring this in the Data Availability Policy, but it is still recommended.) Specific Stata requirements are also often inadequately explained.

                ## Impact

                The median replication package is downloaded from Zenodo 2.4 times a month. This includes views and downloads by author and editorial team. As the figure shows, there is substantial heterogeneity across packages in their download statistics, but all packages have some visibility.

                Download statistics are highly correlated over time. Packages that were popular in the last two years are often downloaded also this year (next Figure). This suggests that the download statistics capture genuine interest and not only driven by early downloads by authors and the editorial team.
