## How Figures are Generated

The figures in output/report.md are created as follows:

1. revisions_time.png - Generated by code/revisions_time.do from temp/collapsed_year.dta
2. editor_time.png, editor_time0.png, editor_time1.png - Generated by code/editor_time.do from temp/collapsed_year.dta
3. revision.png, time_at_editor.png - Generated by code/durations.do from data/git-events.dta
4. downloads_histogram.png - Generated by code/zenodo.do from zenodo data
5. main_issues.png - Generated by code/issues.do from git-events and issues data

## Suggested Makefile Edits

1. Remove output/downloads.png - This file has no generation rule but is listed as a dependency for the PDF
2. Add explicit rules for missing figures:
 - output/downloads_histogram.png needs a rule (currently generated as side effect of zenodo.do)
 - output/main_issues.png needs a rule (currently generated as side effect of issues.do)
3. Clean up the generic pattern rule - Line 15 output/%.png: code/%.do only works for files with matching names
4. Add proper dependencies for intermediate files like temp/collapsed_year.dta

## Files to Delete

1. Root directory clutter:
 • revision_area_chart.png - Old figure not used in current report
 • ManagingEditorsReportAGM20.pdf - Old 2020 report
2. Python files (unused):
 • code/dashboard.py - Appears to be for a 2023 dashboard, not used in current
 workflow
 • code/processing.py - Support file for dashboard
 • code/slider_dates.py - Support file for dashboard
3. Potentially unused .do files:
 • code/success.do - Not referenced in Makefile, appears to be analysis code not
 producing outputs
 • code/commands.do - Creates temp/commands.dta but may not be needed if success.
 do is removed


## Recommended Makefile Structure

The Makefile should:

1. Remove output/downloads.png dependency 
2. Add explicit rules for all PNG outputs instead of relying on side effects
5. Add all target listing main outputs
6. Add intermediate targets for data preparation steps
