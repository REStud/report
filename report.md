## Statistics about waiting times

Almost all packages are accepted only after revisions; most are accepted in two rounds. The table below shows the number of rounds before acceptance for packages accepted by the Data Editor in the 12 months before August 31, 2021.

| Submission rounds before acceptance | Number of packages |
|---|---|
| 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 32 |
| 3 | 24 |
| 4 | 6 |
| 6 | 1 |
| **Total** | **65** | 

Authors receive their first response from the Data Editor within 12 days, on average. This statistic excludes papers where the Data Availability Policy does not apply. Total time at editorial team has an interdecile range of 3 to 40 days, with a median of 17 and mean of 24.4.

| Round | At editor | At author |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 11.8 | 11.8 |
| 2 | 8.5 | 4.6 |
| 3 or more | 8.8 | 1.4 |
| **Total** | **24.4** | **16.9** |

## Impact

The median replication package is viewed on Zenodo 48 times and downloaded 12 times. This includes views and downloads by author and editorial office. As the figure shows, there is substantial heterogeneity across packages in their download statistics.

As we have no baseline measures about the use of replication packages, download statistics will be more useful after a period of observation. The 2022 report will include an analysis of trends and patterns.
